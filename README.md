# Cpp_timetogo
🏃🏻💨 🕗 If you work from home with defined work day time and variable start time you will like this single application. Every day I need to acess the work register system and set the workday begining time and end time. The end time is: start time (variable) + job day hours (fixed) + lunch hours (fixed) and every time I need to do this calculation by myself. Whith timetogo app, I just need type "timetogo" on Linux terminal (anywhere directory) and it show this calculation and the reaming time to "go home". This helped me a lot to avoid register my end workday late. More details in README file.
